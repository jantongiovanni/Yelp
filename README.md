# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Cells reset to back top when the user hits search
      Keyboard autohides when user begins to scroll
